# Web-App

A Group Project which consists in creating the background of a Web using Django.

### Motivation

We are asked to do a project from _Universitat de Lleida_ subject 'Project Web'.

### Application idea

We will make a kind of media database which includes music, movies, etc. using the [iTunes API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) without affiliating where the user can search content in our D.B. and it will be shown all the information about the result.
The user can sing up and log in to a personal space with its information and some additional functionalities such as:

* Creating playlists
* Possibility to rate the media
* Possibility to comment the media
* Send private messages between other users
* Create their own playlists
* Mark the media with a status
    * Plan to listen/watch
    * Currently watching
    * Completed

Moreover, we will use a Free API such as YouTube or SoundCloud to allow the possibility to reproduce the content.
